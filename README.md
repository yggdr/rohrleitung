Rohrleitung
===========

Rohrleitung (ger.): _pipeline_

Didn't like the shell-like approach the other pipelining packages took, where you
would concatenate specially written generators with the UNIX pipe `|`. While that's
great for the CLI and short shell scripts, I wanted a more programmable way.

Worth mentioning is surely [genpipeline](https://github.com/fkarb/genpipeline) that
implements coroutine-based pipelines as presented by [David Beazley's Coroutines
intro](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/). But this means you have to do everything
in coroutines, I built Rohrleitung so I could just use classic generator-based
filters. Look into both and decide which way is cleaner for your environment.

    from functools import partial
    # pip install toolz
    from toolz.curried import interpose

    from rohrleitung import Pipeline, L


    def three_n_plus_one(n):
        if n % 2:
            return 3 * n + 1
        else:
            return n / 2


    @L
    def collatz_length(n, l=0):
        if int(n) < 1:
            raise ValueError('Nope')
        if n == 1:
            return l
        else:
            # L changes call signatures of decorated function, so in recursive ones
            # you have to adapt.
            return collatz_length.__wrapped__(three_n_plus_one(n), l + 1)

    # building pipelines in a programmatic way, without immediately executing them
    # standard list manipulation can change pipeline on the fly
    pipeline = [
        partial(filter, lambda x: x % 2),  # Standard python's filter function
        lambda y: (2 * x for x in y),      # Like using L, but manually
        L(lambda x: x ** 3),               # Using L helper function
        collatz_length,
    ]
    pipeline.append(interpose('a'))
    print(list(Pipeline(pipeline, range(10))))

    a = Pipeline([L(lambda x: 2 * x), L(lambda x: x + 1), L(lambda x: x ** 2)])
    for i, k in enumerate(a(range(3))):
        print("(2x+1)^2, x={}: {}".format(i, k))

    # With toolz' curried filter function we don't need partial
    from toolz.curried import filter
    newpipeline = [
        collatz_length,
        filter(lambda x: not(x % 2)),
        L(lambda x: bin(x)),
        L(lambda x: x.count('1'))
    ]
    p1 = Pipeline(newpipeline)
    for i in p1(range(1, 10)):
        print(i)

    # Reuse same pipeline
    for i in p1(range(1, 3)):
        print(i)

    # Or modify it, then use again
    p1.pipeline.insert(2, L(lambda x: x + 1))
    for i in p1(range(1, 10)):
        print(i)

    p2 = Pipeline(pipeline)
    p3 = 2 * (p2 + [L(lambda x: int(str(x), 16))]) + p1
    # Alternativly 2 * p2 | p1 if you prefer shell syntax
    for i in p3(range(1, 10)):
        print(i)

    # Slicing and cutting pipelines on the fly
    for i in p1[1:4:2](range(10)):
        print(i)
